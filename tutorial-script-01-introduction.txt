Welcome to Music Typesetting with Ambitus

Ambitus is a desktop application available for Windows and Linux, please follow the link in the description if you're interested.

This tutorial covers the basic concepts to get you started with this program. So let's begin.

1. First steps

- On startup it shows keyboard shortcuts
- You can click anywhere into the window to create a new project.
- Select "Violin + Piano", title: Paranoia
- How do you know where to place the note inside the staff?
  - The time is given by a three-component number (slide)
  - The pitch is given by the vertical position within the staff. I can set a plain D
    - SHIFT = sharp
    - CNTRL = flat
  - Also you can shift your note enharmonically by pressing CNTRL+b or CNTRL+#
  - When I set a note which overlaps the duration of another note, the new note will be placed at the nearest free space, which means you don't have to worry about ovelap.
  - Should you place the note too far, you can simply press CNTRL+LEFT arrow to move it to the left
  - You can transpose a selection by pressing CNTRL+UP/DOWN
  - You can use the arrow keys without any alteration to move the note cursor through the staff and PgUP/PgDOWN to move the staff cursor up and down
  - Last but not least you can use SHFT+LEFT/RIGHT keys to increase and decrease the duration of the selected note
  - Or you can press CNTRL+d and CNTRL+h to double the duration or divide it by two.
  - You can press . to add a dot to the duration, i.e. adding half the duration, then a quarter, then an eigth
